# Customer-Churn-Analysis-and-Prediction
This study addresses customer churn in the telecom sector, emphasizing that retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. It explores the use of machine learning models—Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression—within a structured pipeline involving exploratory data analysis, SMOTE for class balancing, recursive feature elimination, and feature importance analysis. Random Forest outperformed the others with the highest F1 score (0.882) and accuracy (96.35%), while KNN showed strong recall for identifying high-risk customers. Logistic Regression, though interpretable, struggled with complex patterns. The study concludes that combining interpretability and predictive performance is key to effective churn prediction and customer retention strategies.
